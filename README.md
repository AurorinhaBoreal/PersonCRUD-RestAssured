# PersonCRUD Rest Assured

This project realize tests in the PersonCRUD project using Rest Assured.

The only point of using it, is that it allows you to test external API's, but because of limitations the PersonCRUD can't be deployed for free.

Because of that, to execute those tests, please go to the [BackEnd](https://github.com/AurorinhaBoreal/PersonCRUD-BackEnd) and run the project.
